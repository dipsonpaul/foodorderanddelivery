A new Flutter project.
Food Order and Delivery App
I developed a Food Order and Delivery App using Flutter that enables users to browse, order, and track food deliveries seamlessly. The app provides an intuitive interface for both customers and delivery personnel, ensuring a smooth ordering and delivery process.

Key Features:
✅ User Authentication: Secure login and registration for customers and delivery personnel.
✅ Restaurant Listings: Displays available restaurants with their menus.
✅ Cart & Checkout: Users can add food to the cart, apply promo codes, and proceed with payments.
✅ Order Tracking with Flutter Maps: Real-time order tracking using Flutter Map, allowing users and delivery personnel to view locations.
✅ Delivery Personnel Login: Dedicated login for delivery personnel to manage assigned orders and view customer details.
✅ Call Functionality: Delivery personnel can call customers directly from the app for smooth coordination.
✅ Search & Filters: Users can search for restaurants and dishes efficiently.
